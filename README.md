# IchorCurate
IchorCurate is a solution curation application to supplement [ichorCNA](https://github.com/broadinstitute/ichorCNA), a tool for estimating the fraction of tumor in cell-free DNA from ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing (ULP-WGS, 0.1x coverage).

As Streamlit powered app, IchorCurate allows users to seamlessly monitor, collaborate, and execute ichorCNA optimal solution selection.
